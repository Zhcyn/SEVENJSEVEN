Mood Board iOS Application intended for musicians, to be used to quickly pull up a genre of songs and listen to a few tracks for inspiration
User can select a genre (listed in a custom collectionView), then pick one of the listed tracks (listed in a TableView), which will then present the track with the options to play and pause, with a progress bar shown to indicate duration of track.
The current application is still under development. The current stage is mainly to test the integrity of the interface and the integrity of the playback logic, and the copyright issue will be improved in the later stage.
If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me.
